# AngularJS-Practice  
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework.  
It can be added to an HTML page with a script tag.  
AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.  
AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.  
The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.  
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.  
The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.  
AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.  
The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the div element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.  
The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.  
AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.  
AngularJS expressions bind AngularJS data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.  
AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.  
AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.  
The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.
